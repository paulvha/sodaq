# AllThingsTalk to Luftdaten

## ===========================================================

## Brief description

A program, driven by parameters, to flexible transfer data from
AllThingsTalk (ATT) to Luftdaten.

## Getting Started
As part of a larger project to understand NB-IOT better, I obtained an
SODAQ AFF / SARA M410 NB-IOT board with Vodafone connection. I have
written a number of sketches, which includes a detailed documentation
for setting up the device in AllThingsTalk (ATT).
From a previous project I already had an account on Luftdaten and wanted
to test how to extract data from ATT and upload to Luftdaten.
I focused on Linux platform using available communication programs as
much as possible. Also wanted to make use of parameter files to enable
a flexible adoption instead of hard coding and recompiling.
This program setup has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and Raspberry Pi.
