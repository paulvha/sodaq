# GPS on SodaQ

## ===========================================================

## Getting Started
The SODAQ board contains a SAM-M8Q Ublox GNSS / GPS receiver. This receiver is very comprehensive and can be configured to your needs, but has limited examples from SODAQ.

Sparkfun (www.sparkfun.com) is a supplier of many different boards and sensors, which it supports with many (great) libraries. They also have boards with Ublox GNSS / GPS receiver, including the SAM-M8Q (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15210).

Their library (https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Ublox_Arduino_Library) is very complete and can be used with minor adjustment for the SODAQ board.

This document describes the must-do change and optional changes.
